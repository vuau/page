# Pen

Encrypted-Decentralized Note Taking App (built with [GunDB](https://gun.eco) + [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)). Free to use at https://pen.now.sh

## Features
- Offline-First  
*Pen can work offline. Your data will be synced accross browsers/devices when you are online. Pen is also a PWA so you can install it on your phone or computer.*
- Encrypted  
*Your data is stored with a bank-level 256-bit AES end-to-end encryption by default, which means nobody but you can read your data.*
- Decentralized   
*Your data is not controlled by a centralized server. There are a server which is just another peer in the network to keep your latest changes always available to sync.*
- Share-able (WIP)  
*In the future, there will be an option to turn off the encryption so that you can publish/share your notes.*
